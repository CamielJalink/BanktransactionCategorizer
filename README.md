# BanktransactionCategorizer

This project is meant as a demonstration of / practice with my React and Typescript skills.

Currently it contains:
- A simple express server-side. Currently it reads banktransactions from a (gitignored) .csv file, 
formats those transactions and returns them to the client side app.
- A client side app created with create-react-app. Attempts to fetch formatted banktransactions from the server-side, 
so that the user can categorize them to help gain insight in his or her spending habits.
